# Facial Mask Recognition with openCV

## The Project

#### Scope/Purpose

This project was made as part of an college course for the studies Computer Science.
The main goal was to show our understanding of Computer Vision with the Python Library: OpenCV, in combination with tensorflow.

**Disclaimer:** This program is not a full release for commercial use, it's merely a small college project with no real use in mind.

#### Concept

This program will detect the presence of a facial mask and if it is worn correctly.
In case the mask is worn correctly a green outline will be shown otherwise (if there is no mask present or worn incorrectly) there will be a red outline.

In case the person is not wearing a mask, the program will take a picture of the persons face (in this case only by pressing the spacebar) and attacht this to an email.
This email will be send to an receiving email address which will be linked to the service personel of the store where it will be used to track down the person and remove them from the building.

**Disclaimer:** This idea was based on the first lockdown measures and following/upcoming measures where not taking into account.
